__Objective:__
Build an app that is functionally similar to this: https://codepen.io/FreeCodeCamp/full/Myvqmo/

__User Stories:__
- I can see whether Free Code Camp is currently streaming on Twitch.tv.
- I can click the status output and be sent directly to the Free Code Camp's Twitch.tv channel.
- If a Twitch user is currently streaming, I can see additional details about what they are streaming.
- I will see a placeholder notification if a streamer has closed their Twitch account (or the account never existed). You can verify this works by adding brunofin and comster404 to your array of Twitch streamers.

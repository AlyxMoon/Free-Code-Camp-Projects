__Objective:__  
Build a full stack JavaScript app that allows you to search for images like this:   https://cryptic-ridge-9197.herokuapp.com/api/imagesearch/lolcats%20funny?offset=10  
and browse recent search queries like this:  
https://cryptic-ridge-9197.herokuapp.com/api/latest/imagesearch/

__User Stories:__  
- I can get the image URLs, alt text and page urls for a set of images relating to a given search string.
- I can paginate through the responses by adding a ?offset=2 parameter to the URL.
- I can get a list of the most recently submitted search strings.

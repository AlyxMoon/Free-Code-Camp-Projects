__Objective:__  
Build an app that is functionally similar to this:  
https://codepen.io/FreeCodeCamp/full/mVEJag

__User Stories:__  
- I can see where all Meteorites landed on a world map.
- I can tell the relative size of the meteorite, just by looking at the way it's represented on the map.
- I can mouse over the meteorite's data point for additional data.

This is the dataset used: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FreeCodeCamp/ProjectReferenceData/master/meteorite-strike-data.json
